# Mandelbrot's set
To show the beauty of math, which is from Mandelbrot's set
1--How to use?
  you can move by your keyboard, which incluing Left, Right, Up, Down, representativing Move to the left, Move to right, Move to up, Move to down.
  Also, you can zoom in or out, by dash or equal to control
2--The disadvantages
  It is utterly slow, more than your imaginationÔºÅBut you can rewrite my programs, it's possible.




  now ,the main(new).cpp using the opengl, it can run faster than before.You can change the maxIterTimes to select the fit precision for you computer ,which is in fragShader.glsl line 12.
  The number of maxIterTimes bigger, the precision higher, but also the payment of calculation higher, which can make you computer run slowly.
